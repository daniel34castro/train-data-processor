Strategy                     | Pros                                       | Cons                                   | Use Case                       
-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------
Flush on Each Send           | Guarantees delivery immediately.           | High latency, poor performance.        | Low message throughput.        
Buffered Flushing (Threshold)| Balances latency and performance.          | Buffered messages may delay delivery.  | Moderate throughput.           
Periodic Flushing (Timeout)  | Decouples flush from message sending.      | Slightly complex implementation.       | Long-running, continuous jobs. 
Explicit Flush Before Exit   | Simple and sufficient for batch workloads. | Relies on explicit program exit flush. | Short-lived batch processing.  


Flush on Each Send - impossible
